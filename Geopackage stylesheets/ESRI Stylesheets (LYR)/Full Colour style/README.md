# OS VectorMap Local Full Colour style

These are LYR files for OS VectorMap Local in Geopackage format for use in ESRI ArcGIS.

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-VectorMap-Local-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Copy the font file 'OS_VMLocal.otf' into your systems font directory (on Windows machines this is (C:\Windows\Fonts)

*Your machine may require a restart for ArcGIS to recognise this new font*

**3.**  Open a new blank map in ArcMap

**4.** Right-click on ‘Layers’ at the top of the Table Of Contents, select Properties… > then General > set Reference Scale to 1:10 000

**5.**  In the labelling toolbar, click on 'Use Maplex Label Engine' to turn on Maplex

**6.**  Click on the ‘Add Data’ button and navigate to the stylesheets folder and the directory that matches your data format, stylesheet format and style preference

**7.**  Select the layer file and click ‘Add’

**8.**  Your Table of Contents should now look like this. This is the recommended layer order:

**9.**  Double-click on a layer to access the ‘Layer Properties’ window > select the ‘Source tab’ > click on ‘Set Data Source…’ > navigate to your OS VectorMap Local data > select the geopackage > select the data that matches the layer > select ‘Add’

Repeat step 8 for all layers.

**10.**  To improve draw order of roads, advanced symbol levels can be applied. Right–click on RoadCLine in the Table of Contents, select Properties… and then the Symbology tab

**11.**  Click on the Advanced dropdown and select Symbol Levels. Select Switch to Advanced View in the bottom-left of the new window and check the box in the top-left corner

**12.** To aid with the orientation of some text and point features we need to apply a calculation to the orientation field within the data. Right click on your Text layer > click Open Attribute Table > right click on the orientation header > select Field Calculator > add the calculation [orientation] /10 > click ok > repeat for your VectorMapPoint layer

 Your map should now look similar to this:

We recommend viewing the map between **1:2,500** and **1:10,000** for maximum legibility

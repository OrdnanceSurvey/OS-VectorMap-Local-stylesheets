# OS VectorMap Local Full Colour style

These are QML files for OS VectorMap Local in GML/GZ format for use in QGIS.

*They have been designed to work with the data as supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-VectorMap-Local-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Copy the font file 'OS_VMLocal.otf' into your systems font directory (on Windows machines this is C:\Windows\Fonts)

**3.**  Copy the folder ‘ordnance_survey’ into your QGIS SVG directory (a typical Windows file path is C:\Program Files\QGIS xxxx\apps\qgis\svg, where xxxx represents whatever version of QGIS you are running).

*Your machine may require a restart for QGIS to recognise the new font and SVGs*

**4.**  Load your OS VectorMap Local GML data into QGIS

**5.**  Double click on a layer to access the 'Layer Properties' window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the QML file that corresponds to that layer > click 'Open' > click 'OK'

*Repeat step 5 for all layers*

**6.**  Your Layers window should now look like below. This is the recommended layer order.

Your map should now look similar to this:

We recommend viewing the map between **1:2,500** and **1:10,000** for maximum legibility
